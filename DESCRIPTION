Description: Extension of 'funHDDC' Schmutz et al. (2018) 
    <doi:10.1007/s00180-020-00958-4> for cases including
    outliers by fitting t-distributions for robust groups. 'TFunHDDC' can cluster
    univariate or multivariate data produced by the 'fda' package for data using
    a b-splines or Fourier basis.
